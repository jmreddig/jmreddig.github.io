I taught Geometry to 7th, 8th, and 9th grade students for one year at the University Scholar's Program with Pennsylvania Leadership Charter School. Though the students were in the middle school, they earned a high school credit for this class. This class was for gifted or high achieving students. 

Major topics addressed in this course:

<ul>
    <li>Inductive and deductive reasoning</li>
    <li>Angle relationships</li>
    <li>Congruence and similarity</li>
    <li>Geometric constructions</li>
    <li>Polygon properties</li>
    <li>Circle properties</li>
    <li>Transformations</li>
    <li>Coordinate Geometry</li>
    <li>Area and volume</li>
    <li>Geometric probability</li>
    <li>Right Triangle Trigonometry</li>
</ul>
