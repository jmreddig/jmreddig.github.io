I taught AP Computer Science A to 11th and 12th grade students for five years at the University Scholar's Program with Pennsylvania Leadership Charter School. This class was for gifted or high achieving students. I created the curriculum from scratch, though I utilized fun projects like the [Sand Lab](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2017/feinberg-falling-sand/). Students finished the year by designing and implementing their own project. Through the years, I've seen students build a Markov chat bot, card games, and classic arcade games like Batsugun.
