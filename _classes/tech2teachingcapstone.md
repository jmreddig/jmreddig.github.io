[Tech to Teaching Program](https://ctl.gatech.edu/tech-teaching)

The Tech to Teaching program is designed to prepare Georgia Tech graduate students and postdocs for college teaching positions. Participants will develop a pedagogical approach that leverages a thorough understanding of evidence-based teaching with reflection on mentored teaching practice.

I took several classes about teaching and learning in higher education. I also completed the capstone, which involves planning, teaching, and reflecting on your instruction in a class. I served as the instructor of record for CS3600 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.
