I taught Foundations to 6th grade students for three years at the University Scholar's Program with Pennsylvania Leadership Charter School. This class was for gifted or high achieving students, typically entering the program for the first time. This was a survey course of all things numerical and geometric, building our number sense in preparation for Pre-Algebra. In addition, we also covered how to take notes in a math class and how to read a math text book.
