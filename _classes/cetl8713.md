This lesson was built as my final project for CETL8713 Teaching and Learning in Higher Education. The presentation provides an overview of assessment methods for educational technology and builds a conceptual understanding of CTT, IRT, AFM, DINA, and BKT. 

At the beginning of the lesson, students are given a pre-filled standardized test in 8th grade mathematics and asked to assess the student. This student only got half the questions correct, and it is difficult to tell from the test what the student needs to practice. Later in the lesson, by using a Q-Matrix and separating out the assessed skills, we find that the student is only missing one of the five assessed skills, and we can target practice much easier.
