My AI Education project explores how students can learn AI concepts through embodied, unplugged activities. These are hands-on, collaborative experiences that let students “become” the AI — making decisions, reasoning with uncertainty, and simulating algorithms before ever touching code. The project focuses on building bridges between intuition and implementation, helping students connect their own reasoning processes to algorithmic ones and supporting a more inclusive, confidence-building approach to AI learning.

I want to explore different ways to scaffold understanding — from physical activities and collaborative reasoning to reflections and coding transitions — so students can connect their own thinking to how AI systems make decisions. I’m especially interested in how these methods can lower barriers to entry, foster confidence, and make AI learning more inclusive and engaging.
