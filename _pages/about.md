I'm Jennifer Reddig, a doctoral student at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I'm a graduate Research Assistant with the [Teachable AI Lab](https://tail.cc.gatech.edu/) under Dr. Chris MacLellan. 

I've been a math and computer science middle and high school teacher, a software engineer, and now a graduate student. I'm passionate about computer science education, accessible education technologies, and using AI to support teachers.
