I'm Jennifer Reddig, a doctoral student at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I'm a graduate Research Assistant with the [Teachable AI Lab](https://tail.cc.gatech.edu/) under Dr. Chris MacLellan. I'm also a MathStreamer with [Carnegie Learning](https://www.carnegielearning.com/solutions/math/mathstream/), making engaging math instructional videos.

I've been a math and computer science middle and high school teacher, a software engineer, and now a graduate student. I'm passionate about computer science education, accessible education technologies, and using AI to support teachers.

Outside of academics, I'm a social swing dancer, a board game nut, and an a cappella music enthusiast who's sometimes writes and produces her own arrangements.
